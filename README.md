# Expense CSV Parser

- Understands CSV expense exports from TD, Wise and Wealthsimple (so far)
- Use LLMs to categorize expenses
- Can persist monthly expense data to datastore
- Helps visualize categorized spending across months
- Single user app for now, feel free to fork

## Why?

- Wanted to experiment with LLMs
- I also use it to track monthly expenses for myself

## Local Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
